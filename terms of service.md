<summary>Pros and Cons</summary>
<br>
As if you want to know I might tell you that Ani Ark Online is an F2P(Free to Play) discord game bot that I made for fun. Well because of that the bot is running in a free server which gives us a great disadvantage.<br>

### Pros<br>
- Free to play<br>

### Cons<br>
- Hosting ends(no 24/7)<br>
- Less Characters<br>
- Shuts down for every 5 mins sometimes.<br>
